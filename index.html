                Hi, I’m Ayushi! I'm a techie-turned-product enthusiast.
                When I’m not talking to users, analyzing their behavior, or creating product roadmaps, I’m able to wear many hats, including designing and building applications. I find it’s most important to focus on finding the right questions to ask. I spend time helping organizations and startups learn how to make human-centric products that users love to use.
                ‍

                <h5>My Focus Area</h5>
                With experience in all aspects of product management, I can own the complete lifecycle of the product right from problem discovery, to launch, and then iterate based on customer feedback.
                <br>
                <h5>Customer Discovery</h5>
                I love talking to customers, performing user research, identifying user personas, understanding their needs and pain points, and synthesizing qualitative information to build new use cases.
                <br>
                <h5>User Experience & Growth</h5>
                I am experienced in optimizing user conversion funnels, building wireframes, copywriting, and conducting in-depth design reviews. All to help improve KPIs, revenues, and user engagement.
                <br>
                <h5>First Principles Thinking</h5>
                I break everything down to the simplest parts and think about it from the first principles. This lets me come up with creative & efficient solutions to seemingly complex problems. 
                <br>
                <h5>Data Analysis & Visualization</h5>
                By looking at quantitative data and usage patterns, I can help uncover insights to improve product adoption and generate new streams of revenue.
